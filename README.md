# Extending multistate models with g-computation to evaluate treatment delay

R code repository for the paper "Extending multistate models with g-computation to  
evaluate treatment delay".

The repository contains the following:

- [Simulation.R](Simulation.R) : main R script which reproduces all simuation results and figures of the manuscript;

- [SimualtionFunctions.R](SimulationFunctions.R): R script for some functions used in the simulation study;

- [Output](Output): Folder with the output of the simulation for the four scenarios described in the paper and two variations of them: (i) using Weibull baseline distribution and (ii) with an extra binomial predictor.

- [Plots](Plots): The figures corresponding to all 12 scenarios.
